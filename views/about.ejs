      <h3>Junk food vs Healthy Food</h3>
      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <p class="about-text">If we look at the scenario today, we see how the fast-food market is increasing at a rapid rate. With the onset of food delivery apps and more, people now like having junk food more. In addition, junk food is also tastier and easier to prepare.</p>
        <p class="about-text">However, just to satisfy our taste buds we are risking our health. You may feel more satisfied after having junk food but that is just the feeling of fullness and nothing else. Consumption of junk food leads to poor concentration. Moreover, you may also get digestive problems as junk food does not have fiber which helps indigestion.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Similarly, irregularity of blood sugar levels happens because of junk food. It is so because it contains fewer carbohydrates and protein. Also, junk food increases levels of cholesterol and triglyceride.</p>
        <p class="about-text">On the other hand, healthy food contains a plethora of nutrients. It not only keeps your body healthy but also your mind and soul. It increases our brain’s functionality. Plus, it enhances our immunity system. Intake of whole foods with minimum or no processing is the finest for one’s health.</p>
        <p class="about-text">In short, we must recognize that though junk food may seem more tempting and appealing, it comes with a great cost. A cost which is very hard to pay. Therefore, we all must have healthy foods and strive for a longer and healthier life.</p>
